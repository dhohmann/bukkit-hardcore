# Hardcore Plugin

This plugin applies hard mode to the server while providing the possibility to remain playing on the server.

## Requirements
Bukkit version: 1.8+

## What does this plugin do?
On startup the server is set to run in hard mode. Normally, this means that when you die, you are prohibited to remain playing on the server. The only way around this is to issue a command to set the game mode for the dead player. Here this plugin comes in handy.

- When a player dies, the player is set to spectator mode.
- Resetting the gamemode for this player is canceled.
- The player will re-spawn after a specified amount of time.

This provided the possibility for you and your friends to play together but still have the restrictions of the hard mode.

Additionally, the mobs will be enhanced when they spawn. They will receive certain buffs and effects.
