# Hardcore Plugin

This plugin applies hard mode to the server while providing the possibility to remain playing on the server. 
It also enhances the spawning creatures to have various effects.

## Requirements
Bukkit version: 1.8+

## What does this plugin do?
On startup the server is set to run in hard mode. Normally, this means that when you die, you are prohibited to remain playing on the server. The only way around this is to issue a command to set the game mode for the dead player. Here this plugin comes in handy.

- When a player dies, the player is set to spectator mode.
- Resetting the game mode for this player is canceled.
- The player will re-spawn after a specified amount of time.

This provided the possibility for you and your friends to play together but still have the restrictions of the hard mode.

Additionally, the mobs will be enhanced when they spawn. They will receive certain buffs and effects.

## Mob enhancements

There are four types of enhancements. 

- Enhancements that apply when a **creature spawn**. Generally, these enhancements apply buffs or items to the spawning creature.
- Enhancements that apply when a **creature is hit**. (Thorn effect) These enhancements may modify the damage the enhanced entity receives or may apply effects to the damager.
- Enhancements that apply when a **creature hits another entity**. (On-hit effect) These enhancements may modify the damage the entity does or apply additional effects to its hits.
- Enhancements that apply when a **creature dies**. These enhancements result in events during or after the death of the creature.
